        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Arancini, also known as arancine, are Italian rice balls that are stuffed, coated with breadcrumbs and deep-fried. They are a staple of Sicilian cuisine. The most common arancini fillings are al ragù or al sugo, filled with ragù, mozzarella or caciocavallo cheese, and often peas, and al burro or ô burru, filled with ham and mozzarella or béchamel sauce.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is soft but not browned.</li>
            <li>Pour in rice; cook and stir until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in wine; cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated.</li>
            <li>Add hot chicken stock to rice, 1/3 cup at a time, stirring and cooking until liquid has evaporated before adding more.</li>

            <li>For each ball, roll 2 tablespoons risotto into a ball. Press 1 mozzarella cube into the center and roll to enclose.</li>
            <li>Coat lightly with flour, dip into milk mixture, then roll in bread crumbs to coat. </li>
            <li>Heat 1 cup vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large deep saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry rice balls in hot oil until evenly golden, turning as needed.</li>
