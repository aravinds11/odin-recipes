In this project, HTML images, links, and lists were utilized to create a well-organized webpage. Images were embedded using the <img> tag to illustrate key concepts and add visual interest. For navigation and external references, hyperlinks were incorporated with the <a> tag, allowing related resources and external sites to be easily accessed by users. Additionally, both unordered lists and ordered lists were used to present information in a clear, structured manner, making the content more accessible and easier to digest. This combination of elements resulted in enhanced overall usability of the project.
